# School_District_Analysis
## Main Objective and Purpose
The objective of this challenge was to alter our code according to changes in our data. With new information that Thomas High School's freshman grades were to be ommitted, we are now required to adjust our analysis. In this challenge, our main objective was to remove the data and perform comparative analysis against our old results. 

## Results 
The school district has asked us to perform comparative analysis on seven distric metrics shown below. 
### 1. Averages in Scores
With the new adjusted data, the entirety of average scores for Freshmans at Thomas High School has been removed and replaced with NaN.

### 2. District Summary Analysis
Original vs Fixed Analysis:

![new1](https://github.com/jeremysz0419/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/new%20district%20summary.PNG)
When viewing the District summary we can see that removing the erroneous scores had very little to no impact on the district summary as a whole. Therefore, we can conclude that the cheating incident at Thomas High School did not affect the district's performance on a large scale. 
### 3. Individual School Summary Analysis
Original vs Fixed Analysis:

![new2](https://github.com/jeremysz0419/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/new%20school%20summary.PNG)
In our original analysis the school summary showed that Thomas High School had an abnormally high passing rate. All of the private rates were above 90%. However, when we perform the analysis after removing the freshman data, we can see that Thomas High Schools passing rate fell to the 60% range. 
### 4. School Rankings

![new3](https://github.com/jeremysz0419/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/new%20school%20ranking.PNG)
Previously in our original analysis, Thomas High School ranked second in overall passing percentage at almost 91%. However, once we have adjusted our data, we see that Thomas High School fell to 8th place in school ranking in terms of overall passing percentage. 
### 5. School Size

![new4](https://github.com/jeremysz0419/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/new%20school%20size.PNG)
We see very little to no changes in percentages based on school sizes. 
### 6. School Type

![new5](https://github.com/jeremysz0419/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/new%20school%20type.PNG)
In terms of school types we see almost no changes as well with the adjusted analysis. 
### 7. School Spending

![new6](https://github.com/jeremysz0419/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/new%20spending.PNG)
We see no changes to our passing percentages based on school spending. 
## Overall Result
1. We saw that there as a big shift in overall passing percentages for Thomas High School. Every category almost fell by 30% when removing the erroneous test scores. 
2. Due the the cheating scandal, Thomas High School fell dramatically in school ranking from the second ranked school to the eigth when it came to students that passed overall.
3. However, on a larger scale we see that there were barely any noticeable differences when it came to district wide analysis. 
4. Similarly, in terms of comparison in other categories such as passing rates based on "School Types", "School Sizes", and "School Spending" there are almost no changes to the result. We can conclude that while the impact of the removing Freshman test scores were significant for Thomas High School itself, the impact on the performance of the school district as a whole was not significant.
